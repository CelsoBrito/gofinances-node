# node-database-upload
> Challenge on NodeJS of database &amp; upload, applied to the goStack bootcamp.

ðŸš€ This project is based on the goStack NodeJS with TypeScript challenge, exploring my knowledge of database and file upload, proposed in a Rocketseat bootcamp.

It was to implement an transaction management application, training what I have learned so far in Node.js with TypeScript, but this time including using a database with TypeORM and sending files with Multer.

Made with ðŸ’œ by **me**.
